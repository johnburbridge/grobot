#Grobot -- the Groovy Robot

***

Grobot is a remote execution framework which draws inspiration from mcollective, Salt, func, and others. Grobot aims to fill in the space for a framework written in java with support for plugins in groovy. 

Grobot consists of a server (the master) and agents that run on the remote target hosts (the minions). The master's role is to collect information from the minions, dispatch jobs, monitor and report on the status of jobs.
